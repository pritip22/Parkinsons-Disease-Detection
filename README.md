# Parkinsons-Disease-Detection
The Parkinson's disease detection system utilizes a sophisticated algorithm known as Support Vector Machine (SVM) to effectively diagnose the condition. SVM analyzes various data points and patterns to distinguish between individuals with Parkinson's disease and those without. Moreover, the system incorporates a user-friendly predictive model, where an output value of 0 suggests that the individual is healthy, while a value of 1 indicates the presence of Parkinson's disease. This straightforward output format enhances the system's usability, making it easier for healthcare professionals and patients to interpret and utilize the diagnostic results effectively. Consequently, this streamlined approach enhances accessibility to accurate diagnosis and facilitates prompt intervention and treatment for individuals affected by Parkinson's disease.
